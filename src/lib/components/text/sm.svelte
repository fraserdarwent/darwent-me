  Having seen the benefits that Agile delivery can bring to businesses I decided
  to take time to achieve my Scrum Alliance <b>ScrumMaster certification</b>.
  Since then I have helped guide client delivery teams through their journey
  from legacy delivery approaches which were putting them on the back foot in
  the market with a high level of risk to change, to embrace more Agile
  practices with more frequent deployments, improved forecasting, and improved
  product reliability.
